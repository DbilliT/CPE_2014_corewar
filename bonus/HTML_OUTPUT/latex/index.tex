\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\section{What is the corewar ?}\label{index_intro_sec}
The Corewar is a game, a very special game. It consists in making small programs fight in a virtual machine. The goal of the game is to prevent other programs from functioning correctly, by any means necessary. The game will create a virtual machine in which programs (written by the players fight. The objective of each process is to \char`\"{}survive\char`\"{}. By \char`\"{}survive\char`\"{}, we means execute a special instruction (live) that means \char`\"{}hey, iâ€™m still alive !\char`\"{}. These programs run simultaneously in the virtual machine, and in the same memory space, so they can write on each other. The winner of the game is the last program who ran the \char`\"{}live\char`\"{} instruction.

It will allow you to write programs destined to fight. It will need to understand the assembly language, and generate binary programs that can be interpreted by the virtual machine.\hypertarget{index_The}{}\subsection{Virtual Machine}\label{index_The}
It will house the binary programs (the champions) and provide them with a standard execution environment. It offers a lot of features useful to the fight. It goes without saying that it has to be able to run multiple programs simultaneously (or the fights will be really, really dull...).
